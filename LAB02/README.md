# GEOG_678 Lab 02

## ArcGIS Online App Creation and Collector

### Purpose
The purpose of this lab was to:
1. learn how to use ArcGIS Online to create not only a map but also an app that would work on other devices
2. learn how to create a data collection layer to use in Collections (now called Field Maps).



### ArcGIS Online App

The ArcGIS Online tutorial used obesity data for the United States and the lab directions specifically asked for a focuse on Texas.  The app was created per these instructions.

### ArcGIS Collector

The tutorial asked for the creation of a layer to collect data points related to a park (picnic tables, bathrooms, and water fountains).  Then the data was added in through the use of the Field Maps app.  I mapped the park near me called Bear Branch.
